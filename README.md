## 1.1.9 Modified stock firmware with enabled EEPROM (M500)

This is the stock firmware from Artillery for the Sidewinder X1. No other changes are made except enabling the EEPROM save feature (M500).

You might want to compile it on your own using Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code. If you don't, I've provided the compiled .hex-file aswell.

Use Cura or PrusaSlicer for flashing.

Remember:
You will need to open the bottom case and remove the red-black wire JST connector from the TFT in order to flash the firmware!
